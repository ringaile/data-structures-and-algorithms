TASK 0:
We just access the element in two arrays:
Approximate run time is O(1)

TASK 1:
We have to loop through calls and texts once:
Approximate run time is O(n)

TASK 2:
we have two loops, one is going through each element in calls O(n) and other one is nested loop O(nˆ2)
Approximate run time is O(n + nˆ2)

TASK 3:
We have three loops going through calls (or subset of calls):
Approximate run time is O(3n)

TASK 4:
We have two loops going throgh calls and texts:
Approximate run time is O(n)
